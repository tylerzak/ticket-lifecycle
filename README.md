Agents can view active tickets in the Agent Panel. Queue managers assign priority tickets to the correct agents and ensure SLAs are met.

<p>
In this example, the ticket is prioritized as "Emergency" because of its potential impact on a critical business area, and the SLA plan is updated to "Sev-A" to match its severity.

<p>
The ticket was closed after determining that the root cause was related to a recent update, with the resolution noted at the bottom of the page. The vendor was promptly notified, and users were able to log in without any further issues. The status was then updated to "Resolved."
