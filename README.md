When users encounter an issue that requires assistance, they can submit a support ticket with relevant details. For example, a customer opens a new ticket under the "Business Critical Outage" category, reporting that the online banking system is down.

Agents can access and manage active tickets through the Agent Panel, where they can prioritize tasks and track progress. Queue managers ensure that high-priority tickets are routed to the appropriate agents for timely resolution.

</p>
<p>
In this case, the ticket is prioritized as "Emergency" due to its potential impact on a critical business area. As the agent works to resolve the issue, the SLA plan is updated to "Sev-A" to align with the severity and urgency of the situation.

</p>
<p>
The ticket was closed after identifying that the root cause was linked to a recent update. With the issue resolved, the vendor was notified, and users were able to log in without further complications. The status was then updated to "Resolved," and the user was informed of the fix.
